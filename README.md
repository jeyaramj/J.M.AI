# J.M.AI
A project that will provide a UI to ask a question by typing the text and find answered based on
  1) Previously accepted answers
  2) Text classification based on existing models
  3) Web search
  
* Users will be able to rate the answer to train existing model(s).

* Planning to start with SynapticJS once the MLP is complete, take a look at the performance.

* If there would be a difficult question, it would be ideal to have a feature to queue the question and notify the answers by email.

* One of the challenging tasks is to determine what the time cost of a question is. This should initially be based on predefined parameters such as number of words and the weight of each noun based on previous searches.
